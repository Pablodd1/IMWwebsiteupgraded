      "h": "How NAD+ Therapy Works",
      "p": [
        "NAD+ therapy works by increasing the levels of NAD+ in the body, a coenzyme that is essential for cellular function and energy production. As we age, NAD+ levels decline, leading to reduced energy and faster cellular aging. NAD+ therapy aims to reverse these effects by replenishing this critical molecule."

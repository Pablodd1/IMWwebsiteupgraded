                "Spinal decompression therapy is a non-invasive treatment designed to alleviate back pain and improve spinal function. By gently stretching the spine, it creates negative pressure, helping to relieve pressure on herniated discs and improve nutrient flow. Patients often report significant reductions in pain and enhanced mobility after treatment. It's an ideal solution for those suffering from chronic back pain or disc issues, aiming to restore a pain-free lifestyle.",
                "In addition, spinal decompression therapy helps with sciatica, degenerative disc disease, and herniated discs. During the treatment, patients lie comfortably on a specialized table that gently pulls the spine, allowing for proper alignment and relief. Many patients experience immediate pain relief and increased range of motion, leading to a more active lifestyle. Spinal decompression not only addresses existing pain but also works as a preventive measure to keep the spine healthy."

  "heading": "What Is VTone, and How Does It Work?",
  "paragraph1": "VTone is an innovative intravaginal device that uses electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) to rehabilitate weak pelvic floor muscles. Think of it as a highly advanced workout for muscles you can't target through traditional exercise alone. This technology works by inserting a specialized applicator that delivers gentle electrical impulses, triggering involuntary muscle contractions similar to Kegel exercises but significantly more effective. These contractions strengthen the pelvic floor, improve muscle tone, and restore neuromuscular control.",
  "paragraph2": "Most patients describe the sensation as a gentle pulsing or tingling that is never painful. During each 30-minute session, our trained specialists carefully control and adjust the intensity to ensure optimal comfort and effectiveness throughout your treatment.",
